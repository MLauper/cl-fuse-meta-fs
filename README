meta-fs: completely Lisp-level bindings for CL-FUSE

The idea is that you specify contents of your FS as the results of running
functions that can return files or functions generating directories (of course,
there are also callbacks for modification)

Load file lisp-meta-fs-test.lisp to see it in action in /tmp/test

Among other things, this allows browsing Lisp packages and symbols in them.
